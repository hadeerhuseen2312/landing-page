                <p>Warner Bros. Movie World is a theme park on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. Owned and operated by Village Roadshow's Theme Parks division, the park opened on 3 June 1991 after a star-studded opening ceremony the previous day. Many park attractions are based on Warner Bros. and related DC Comics properties, including thrill rides such as Batwing Spaceshot and Superman Escape, family attractions such as Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D and Wild West Falls Adventure Ride, entertainment at the Roxy Theatre and the Hollywood Stunt Driver live show. Film characters regularly roam the grounds to interact and take photos with guests. Each afternoon, characters participate in a parade along Main Street.</p>
